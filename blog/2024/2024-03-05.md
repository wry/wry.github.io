# 2024-03-05 - Homebrew custom curl args

To my surprise there didn't seem to be a straight forward way to do this for the custom case I had and no solution I found worked for me, so I had to come up with one.

IMO the simplest way to pass parameters to curl is through `~/.curlrc`, by setting the `HOMEBREW_CURLRC` env var to `1`. In the case of [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/product) this is what I've been using, because this way I could pass `-n` to curl and it used my `~/.netrc` file to fetch the credentials and do the auth.

However, this solution doesn't work for everything. Some servers require tokens or whatever else and you can't do complex logic in a curlrc file. In this case the only solution I found was to use a custom `download strategy`, as explained briefly in brew's [formula cookbook](https://docs.brew.sh/Formula-Cookbook#url-download-strategies) doc.

In the example they used the `fetch` method, but all I wanted was to add args to curl, so I ended up with :

```ruby
require "download_strategy"

class MyDownloadStrategy < CurlDownloadStrategy
  def curl_args(*extra_args, connect_timeout: nil, max_time: nil, retries: Homebrew::EnvConfig.curl_retries.to_i, retry_max_time: nil, show_output: false, show_error: true, user_agent: nil, referer: nil)
    token = ENV['FOO_BAR_TOKEN']
    args = []
    args << "--header" << "X-FOO-BAR-TOKEN: #{token}"
    args + extra_args
  end
end

class Foo < Formula
  url "something", using: MyDownloadStrategy
end
```

Whether this is the correct way, -shrugs-, but for now it will have to do.
