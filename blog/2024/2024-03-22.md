# crashlytics, lldb, radare2, arm64

Every now and then crashlytics will show functions in a stack trace that one cannot set a symbolic breakpoint to through xcode. Today I wanted to investigate one of these crashes.

## the dive

The stack trace looks something like this :

```shell
0  CoreFoundation                 0xecb28 __exceptionPreprocess
1  libobjc.A.dylib                0x2af78 objc_exception_throw
2  Foundation                     0x6ba920 _userInfoForFileAndLine
3  Module                         0x28e554 -[OtherClass some_methodName:withParameter:] + 42 (OtherClass.m:42)
4  Module                         0x23c2a4 -[SomeClass someMethod] + 42 (SomeClass.m:42)
```

The disassamble cmd in lldb is `dis` and as args I either pass the sym with `-n <name>` or the address with `-a <address>`. I know that the arch is `arm64`, so I locate the `arm64` lib inside its `.xcframework` and open it using `lldb` :

```shell
% lldb <path>
```

Once in lldb, since this isn't a live session and no vaddr must be taken into account, I can straight away get to the point and check the function using the name... except that doesn't work this time. So next best I go for the certain and peek inside the function that the offset in the stacktrace is given :

```shell
(lldb) dis -ba 0x23c2a4
Module`___lldb_unnamed_symbol12153:
Module[0x23c230] <+0>:   0xd10143ff   sub    sp, sp, #0x50
...
Module[0x23c28c] <+92>:  0xf0001548   adrp   x8, 683
Module[0x23c290] <+96>:  0xf9463d01   ldr    x1, [x8, #0xc78]
...
Module[0x23c2a0] <+112>: 0x9403d322   bl     0x330f28                  ; symbol stub for: objc_msgSend
Module[0x23c2a4] <+116>: 0xaa1403e0   mov    x0, x20
...
```

The offset of the function is `0x23c230`, and since `pc` was set to `0x23c2a4` we can assume that `0x23c2a0` is where the next function was called that shows up as part of the stack trace.

This is an `objc_msgSend`, which makes sense in an objc environment.

Knowing the parameters sent to this function and the way the C ABI works on arm64, we know that `x0` will have the instance and `x1` will have the address of the method name in a cstring. If you take a look at the output I pasted above, you'll see that even though lldb is usually pretty diligent and retrieves the symbol names for us, it didn't do it this time and `+96` doesn't have a `; symbol name` at the end of the line. However, let's see what's at that address anyway...

Since ldr calcs the value for `x1` using `x8`, we need to know that reg's value :

```shell
Module[0x23c28c] <+92>:  0xf0001548   adrp   x8, 683
```

`adrp` is one of those arm mnemonics that you'll need to take a deep breath to understand, but here's what the ARM doc says :

```
Form PC-relative address to 4KB page adds an immediate value that is shifted left by 12 bits, to the PC value to form a PC-relative address, with the bottom 12 bits masked out, and writes the result to the destination register.
```

And it means :

* pc + imm lsh 12 : `val = 0x23c28c + (683<<12)`
* 4KB page aligned : `val &= ~((1<<12)-1)`

Now that we know what `x8` contains we can continue :

```shell
Module[0x23c290] <+96>:  0xf9463d01   ldr    x1, [x8, #0xc78]
```

This is a much simpler operation and it just adds the imm value to x8, then copies the value found at that address. Part of what I love about lldb is that it can be used as a calculator and use that value as part of the expression passed to its commands :

```shell
(lldb) mem read ((0x23c28c+(683<<12))&(~((1<<12)-1)))+0xc78)
0x004e7c78: 66 24 41 00 00 00 00 00 4e 58 40 00 00 00 00 00  f$A.....NX@.....
```

Finally we'd want to read the memory at the address stored at the calculated address and since we know it's a cstring, we can pass the correct format to `mem read` :

```shell
(lldb) mem read -f c-string 0x412466
0x00412466: "some_methodName:withParameter:"
```

The output of the cmd matches the method name shown on the crashlytics stacktrace and that would be the end of the story... but how about rewinding a bit, just to see how the fascinating arm opcodes work?

## arm64

I usually also use radare2 when I collect info about binaries and noticed that although lldb showed `683` as the value passed to `adrp`, in radare2 the same two lines looked like this running `pdf` :

```shell
            0x0023c28c      481500f0       adrp x8, 0x4e7000
            0x0023c290      013d46f9       ldr x1, [x8, 0xc78]         ; 0x412466 ; char *selector
```

It looks like the order of bytes is reversed, so let's check which is the original one :

```shell
% od -t x1 -N 4 <path> 0x0023c28c       
023c28c    48  15  00  f0 
```

Then we also have the difference in value and even if lldb has decimal and radare2 has hex, they are clearly not the same. Radare2 also didn't show what the actual selector is (it does if you `pdc` though), but it clearly got the address right. So what is the actual address passed to `adrp`'s opcode? One can find it out using the [Arm A-profile A64 Instruction Set Architecture](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0602/2023-12/Base-Instructions/ADRP--Form-PC-relative-address-to-4KB-page-) doc.

Running the instruction through lldb can help us decipher it :

```shell
(lldb) e -f bin -- 0xf0001548
(unsigned int) $0 = 0b11110000000000000001010101001000
```

Taking it apart we have (op, immlo, const, immhi, reg) :

`1 11 10000 0000000000010101010 01000`

The immediate value is `0b1010101011`, or converted to the value used by lldb :

```shell
(lldb) p 0b1010101011
(int) 683
```

Not sure if it's a bug in radare2 and running the bytes through `rasm2` just further confuses things, but at least radare2 shows the final address correctly when loading it into `x1`.
