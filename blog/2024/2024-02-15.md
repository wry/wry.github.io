# 2024-02-15 - bitmap fonts

A long time ago working on [Enterprise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_(computer)) when we needed to use [sprites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprite_(computer_graphics)) in a program, we had a checkered notebook in which we'd fill 8x8 (or whatever resolution) rectangles to represent pixels, then we'd calculate the values that we needed for the image data. Back then fonts were also represented in bitmaps, so text on the screen was made up from these font images. Since these fonts were cumbersome to scale later vector fonts became the norm and while you can - and should, because they're awesome - still see bitmap fonts used on old computers, you won't see them used on modern ones anymore.

## Font Generation

In a recent conversation about displaying text on a led display and entering the [bitmap fonts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_font#Bitmap_fonts) by hand I thought if in the same situation I'd either go for my `gentxt` solution using dos fonts or if I'd need less bits to represent a font, I'd quickly write a script to convert a solution akin to the old pen & paper one I learned decades ago.

An idea without pen & paper is equally simple (although it works better if using monospace fonts in the text editor). You draw your letters using only two characters 

* one you'll use to mark the 'filled' pixels
* the other you'll use to mark the 'empty' ones

So something like this, for the letter 'K' : 

```
-++---++
-++--++-
-++-++--
-++++---
-+++++--
-++-++--
-++--++-
-++---++
```

Using '-' to represent empty pixels and '+' to represent filled ones.

Then you convert them to some format your favourite prog lang knows. Don't know about other languages, but converting them using perl would be something like :

```
while(<STDIN>) {
  chomp;
  my @b = unpack("c*");
  my $n = 0;
  for(my $i=0; $i<@b; $i++) {
    $n |= $b[$i] == ord($P) ? 1<<($#b-$i) : 0;
  }
  printf("0b%08b,\n", $n);
}
```

For each EOL terminated line piped to the program via `stdin`, you

* get rid of the EOL char
* convert the string of chars to a perl char array
* for each char
    * flip the bit at the position of the char if it matches `$P`
* print the resulting value in binary format, so it can be included in code
