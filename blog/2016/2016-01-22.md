# 2016-01-22 - VirtualBox osx host, ubuntu guest - "Waiting for network configuration"

wanted to cross-compile a project to raspi1 on an ubuntu guest in vbox. ubuntu had `eth0` in `/etc/network/interfaces`, but `eth0` didn't exist. attempting to conf eth1 with ifconfig worked, so changed references to eth0 in the /etc file to eth1, works like a charm. hooray for pokey!
