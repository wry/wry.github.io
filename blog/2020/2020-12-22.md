# 2020-12-22 - vscode + paulhocker.kick-assembler-vscode-ext

first and foremost huge thanks for both this extension and kickass, they're bringing back childhood memories and i'm having a blast with them.

there's one thing on mac that doesn't work though and that's probably due to the way vice is installed on mac these days. earlier it used to be installed as an `Application`, nowadays - at least through [brew](https://brew.sh/) - it's a  collection of programs you can run from a terminal. the issue is that when you press F5/F6 you see vice launched, but the prg you compile isn't autostarted.

tried looking for a fix but couldn't find any, so came up with the following - most probably incorrect - way of fixing it.

you need to update the following file (just replace the version number; obvio) :

`~/.vscode/extensions/paulhocker.kick-assembler-vscode-ext-0.4.11/client/out/commands/CommandRun.js`

the section where the 'darwin' platform is mentioned should not use 'open', just run the emu runtime directly, as in :

```js
            let emu = child_process_1.spawn(emulatorRuntime, ["-autostartprgmode", "1", "-autostart", program, ...emulatorOptions], {
                detached: true,
                stdio: 'inherit',
                shell: true
            });
```
