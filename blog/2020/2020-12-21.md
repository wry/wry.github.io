# 2020-12-21 - virtual webcam on mac

so virtual webcams (the DAL plugin way) are an option these days, some app based on them should be relatively easily doable. a very nice clean sample code of one is here : [https://github.com/johnboiles/coremediaio-dal-minimal-example](https://github.com/johnboiles/coremediaio-dal-minimal-example) thanks to the author of the obs-mac-virtualcam plugin for OBS.

the author's put the instructions on their github page. if you compile it even in debug mode and then dump the plugin in the path they mention, quicktime and firefox will recognize it out of the box.

there's a prob with entitlements, so some apps might not recognize it, just google for a solution. codesign may or may not help - tbh as long as there's a single browser that supports it i'm happy.

if you want to check that your plugin once installed at least in theory should work :

```shell
% system_profiler SPCameraDataType
```

once you install it and switch to the virtual webcam input (using a supported app) you should see an animated red box.
