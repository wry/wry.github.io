# 2013-05-26 - FIPS compilant OpenSSL

so there's a project for which we needed to have a fips compliant openssl lib and i finally managed to roll one (on osx). not as straight forward as one would like and the Android issue of no out of the box support for versioned shared libs just further complicated things. as i found no single source of help on this, i put one together and pushed it up to [my github acc](https://github.com/wry/opensslfips). thanks to the multiple sources and particularly to [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11091905/android-build-openssl-fips-2-0) thread for the ideas regarding the versioned shlib workaround.
