# 2013-04-25 - iOS Mobile provisioning profiles

the other day i ran into an issue within xcode, where it'd use the wrong provisioning profile to roll my ipa with, so here goes a q/d hack to find the uuid of the mobile pp an ipa was created with :

```
#!/bin/sh

# get the UUID of the mobile provisioning profile an .ipa file was signed with

IPA=$1
APP=$(unzip -l $IPA | egrep 'Payload/.*.app/$' | awk '{ print $4 }')
PP="${APP}embedded.mobileprovision"

unzip -p $IPA $PP | strings | grep -A 1 '<key>UUID</key>' | grep string | sed -e 's/\<string\>\(.*\)\<\/string\>/\1/g'
```
