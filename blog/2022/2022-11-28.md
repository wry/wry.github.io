# 2022-11-28 - Crash -> ASAN -> binary patch

## crash

every now and then one strikes gold using the address sanitizer (asan) and this can help us solve issues in third party libs - we have no sources for - as well. in this particular case it spotted an issue where memory was dealloc'd, but then accessed.
this was no issue on iOS 15, but in iPadOS 16 they made a change : `The system memory allocator free operation zeroes out all deallocated blocks in iPadOS 16 beta or later.` they introduced the same change to iOS 16.1.

this meant that from these versions the app started to crash, due to the error in the third party lib.

## debug

with the help of asan it was easy to see where the memory that is later accessed is alloc'd, so to solve the prob you'd

* set a br after the line of code that does the alloc
* check the ret val (see c abi call conventions for your arch)
* set a watch for that address
* continue, the debugger will break when it's 'changed' (cleared)
* decide what to do with the code (the simplest would be to nop it, but this will depend on the case)

## nop

* use lldb `image lookup -a <address>` to find the file offset of the code
* it'll be in hex, so convert it to decimal (eg. using lldb `p`)
* decide on how many bytes you'll nop (in my case this was 4)
* use `lipo -thin <arch> -output <path>` to get the lib for the arch you're patching
* use a hex edit or whatever; i went with something i wrote earlier, for another case : `perl -e "print pack('cccc', 0x90, 0x90, 0x90, 0x90 );" | dd of=./ThirdPartyLib_arm64 bs=1 count=4 conv=notrunc seek=<file_offset_in_decimal>`
* use `lipo -create <file1> <file2> .... -output <framework>` to put the universal binary back together
