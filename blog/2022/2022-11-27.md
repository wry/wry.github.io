# 2022-11-27 - debugging a third party android app

 trying to debug a crash in an android app that i don't have the sources for i realized that i needed a refreshener of a few things after almost 3 years since i last reverse engineered android code.

* resigning using your dev keystore still works well with apktool/jarsigner/zipalign, though i had to pass a `-p` arg to zipalign, which i don't recall having to do before
* in addition to enabling `android:debuggable` i also had to enable `android:extractNativeLibs`
* `adb` can be used to `pull` also from `/data/` as long as you know the full path (use `pm` for this)
* i gotta look into smali debugging using [smalidea](https://github.com/JesusFreke/smalidea), since it seems that [intellij](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) - as i had expected, though never really looked into it - doesn't allow gdb/lldb style debugging, you either own the sources or you can't set breakpoints, even though it lets you see the smali code if you attach the apk for debugging through the file menu
