# 2018-03-12 - android sdk systrace probs

systrace :

- if it fails on an adb usb connection because it can't scp the trace output (eg.: `ssh: connect to host port 22: Connection refused`), try connecting to the box using an ssh tunnel
- if you get `/system/bin/sh: printf: not found` and have busybox, just create a symlink to it
