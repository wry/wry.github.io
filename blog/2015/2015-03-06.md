# 2015-03-06 - Additional Chrome With Disabled Security (OSX)

i got the task of creating a websockets based connector for a cross-platform app and the html part also loads j/s from local fileuris in an async manner, so an additional chrome with disabled security was needed :

```
open -n -a 'Google Chrome.app' --args --args --disable-web-security --user-data-dir=/tmp/sdf
```
