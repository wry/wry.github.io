# 2015-10-20 - XWalkWebView

so in case you run into this :

```
Please have your activity extend XWalkActivity for shared mode
```

while using the awesome __xwalkwebview__. it may be because you forgot to (or it's disabled by scm rules) commit the .so file in the library project; the android lib will be used, everything will compile, but the .so files will be missed and it will look like you chose 'shared mode' on purpose.
